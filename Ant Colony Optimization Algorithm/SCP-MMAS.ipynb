    "In order to manage our algorithm's computations effectively, we have introduced an `Ant` class. This class is designed to encapsulate all the attributes for each ant's individual solution within the algorithm's context. Detailed below are the key attributes and methods this class has:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **U (Universe):** Represents the complete set of elements available for forming solutions. It defines the total space from which sets are selected.\n",
    "- **S (Sets):** A collection of all sets available for selection.\n",
    "- **C (Cost):** Associated with each set in `S`, this attribute represents the cost of including a particular set in the solution. It’s utilized to calculate the overall solution cost.\n",
    "- **Solution (sol):** This attribute is a list containing indexes of sets in `S` that comprise the ant's final solution. It effectively represents which sets from `S` have been chosen.\n",
    "- **uncovered:** A set containing elements from the universe (`U`) that are yet to be covered by the chosen sets in the final solution. It helps in identifying the elements still missing from the solution.\n",
    "- **cost:** Denotes the overall cost of the ant's solution, derived by summing up the costs of all selected sets within the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **setUncovered():** This method operates by deducting elements of the selected sets (as part of the solution) from the universe (`U`). The resulting set captures elements that are still uncovered, i.e., elements of `U` not included in any of the selected sets. It refreshes the `uncovered` attribute with these elements, thus identifying what's missing from the current solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **calculateCost():** By iterating through the indexes listed in the `sol` attribute (which indicates the sets included in the solution), this method accumulates the costs associated with each selected set. Summing these costs provides the total cost of the ant's solution, which is then stored in the Cost attribute.\n"
