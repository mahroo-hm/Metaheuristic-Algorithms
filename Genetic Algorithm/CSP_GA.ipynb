        "The effectiveness of a genetic algorithm for solving CSP depends on the choice of parameters such as the population size, selection method, crossover operator, and mutation rate. Careful tuning of these parameters is necessary to achieve good performance. Additionally, some modifications to the basic genetic algorithm can be made to improve its performance, such as using local search methods to improve the quality of the individuals in the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the CSP is to minimize the waste and sebsequently number of rolls, so a natural choice for the fitness function is to caculate the number of rolls based on the sum of th pattern of the chromosome.\n",

When an index from Parent2 is not present in Child1, it is appended to the end of Child1’s chromosome; if the index is already present, we proceed to the next element in Parent2’s chromosome.\n",

        "3. fitness: For the solution *chromosome*, the sum of elements form i = 0 to i = length_os_solution is calculated. during calculation if the *curr_sum* exceeds the stock_length, number of rolls is incremented. The output is a percentage of optimal solution. If the cost is 100% it means the desired solution is achieved, if cost < 100% the number of rolls is higher than the desired answer and if cost > 100% we have reached a optimal solution.\n",
