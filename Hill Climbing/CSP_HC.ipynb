        "**Hill Climbing** is a simple optimization algorithm to find the best possible solution for a given problem. It belongs to the family of local search algorithms and is often used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Hill Climbing, the algorithm starts with an initial solution and then iteratively makes small changes to it in order to improve the solution. These changes are based on a heuristic function that evaluates the quality of the solution. The algorithm continues to make these small changes until it reaches a local maximum, meaning that no further improvement can be made with the current set of moves."
